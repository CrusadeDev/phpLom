# phpLom

This is my try to on creating lombok in php. On the start i was really intrested in that idea beacuse it would save some time generating getters/setters/constructor
but after talks with colleges and my own thoughts i I came to the conclusionthat this is not a greatest idea. Mostly beacuse of not a greatest soulution in overriding classes 
on autoloading (there are other possible solutions but im not sure about them ex. overriding opcache or ovveriding main files of production). In the end i decides to scrap 
this idea. Code is not the greates but most of it should work.
